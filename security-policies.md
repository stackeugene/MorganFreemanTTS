1. Authentication and Access Control

Require strong authentication (OAuth 2.0, API keys, or JWT tokens) for accessing the TTS service.
Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access to system components.
Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access.

2. Data Encryption & Secure Transmission

Encrypt stored voice data using AES-256.
Secure API requests and responses with TLS 1.2 or higher.
Prevent unauthorized data interception using HTTPS-only communication.

3. Input Validation & Protection Against Injection Attacks

Sanitize user input to prevent SQL Injection, XSS, or command injection attacks.
Limit text length and special characters that users can submit.

4. Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection

Set API request limits to prevent abuse (e.g., 100 requests per minute per user).
Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block automated bots and potential DDoS attacks.
Implement CAPTCHA for public endpoints to prevent bot abuse.

5. Logging & Monitoring

Enable real-time monitoring of API requests and system logs using SIEM tools.
Store logs in a centralized logging system with retention for at least 90 days.
Implement anomaly detection for unusual TTS requests (e.g., excessive requests from a single IP).

6. Secure Storage & Data Retention

Store user-generated voice data only as long as necessary.
Implement automatic log deletion after a defined retention period (e.g., 30 days).
Use role-based permissions to restrict access to stored audio files.

7. Incident Response Plan

Establish an incident response protocol in case of a security breach.
Ensure that automatic alerts are sent for suspicious activities.
Conduct regular penetration tests to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
