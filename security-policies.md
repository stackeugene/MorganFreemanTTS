# Security Policies

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the security policies and procedures designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its data.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and third parties who have access to the organization's systems, network, or data.

## Policies

### 1. Access Control
- Access to systems and data must be granted based on the principle of least privilege (PoLP).
- All users must authenticate using strong passwords and/or multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Passwords must meet complexity requirements and be changed periodically.
- User accounts must be reviewed regularly and deactivated immediately upon termination of employment or contract.
- Administrative privileges must be restricted to authorized personnel only.

### 2. Data Protection
- Sensitive data must be encrypted both in transit (e.g., using TLS) and at rest (e.g., AES-256).
- Regular backups must be performed, encrypted, and stored securely in geographically diverse locations.
- Data access logs must be maintained, monitored, and reviewed periodically for suspicious activity.
- Data retention policies must be defined and followed to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

### 3. Network Security
- Firewalls must be configured to restrict unauthorized access and allow only necessary traffic.
- All incoming and outgoing traffic must be monitored for suspicious activity using intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).
- VPNs must be used for secure remote access to the network.
- Wireless networks must be secured using WPA3 encryption and strong passwords.
- Public-facing services must be protected with web application firewalls (WAFs) where applicable.

### 4. Incident Response
- All security incidents must be reported immediately to the security team via the designated reporting process.
- An incident response plan (IRP) must be in place, documented, and tested regularly.
- Incident response procedures must include containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.
- Post-incident reviews must be conducted to identify root causes and implement corrective actions.

### 5. Software Security
- All software and systems must be kept up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.
- Vulnerability scans must be conducted regularly, and identified vulnerabilities must be remediated promptly.
- Only approved and licensed software may be installed on company systems.
- Development teams must follow secure coding practices and conduct code reviews to prevent vulnerabilities.

### 6. Employee Training
- Employees must undergo mandatory security awareness training at least annually.
- Training must include topics such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and data protection.
- Phishing simulations must be conducted periodically to test employee readiness and improve awareness.
- Employees must acknowledge and agree to comply with security policies annually.

### 7. Physical Security
- Access to sensitive areas (e.g., data centers, server rooms) must be restricted to authorized personnel only.
- Physical access controls such as keycards, biometric authentication, or PINs must be implemented.
- Visitors must be escorted and logged when accessing secure areas.
- Devices storing sensitive data must be physically secured to prevent theft or tampering.

## Enforcement
Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract. Legal action may also be pursued where applicable.

## Review and Updates
This policy must be reviewed and updated annually or as needed to address new security threats, changes in technology, or regulatory requirements.
