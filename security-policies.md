Security Measures for the TTS System
1️⃣ Authentication & Access Control

Require secure login methods like OAuth 2.0, API keys, or JWT tokens.
Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to limit who can access different parts of the system.
Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for admin users.
2️⃣ Data Encryption & Secure Transmission

Encrypt stored voice data using AES-256 to keep it safe.
Use TLS 1.2 or higher to protect API requests.
Ensure all communications happen over HTTPS to prevent data interception.
3️⃣ Input Validation & Protection Against Attacks

Sanitize user input to block SQL Injection, XSS, and command injection attacks.
Restrict the length and type of characters users can submit.
4️⃣ Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection

Limit API requests to 100 per minute per user to prevent abuse.
Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block bots and DDoS attacks.
Add CAPTCHA on public endpoints to prevent automated abuse.
5️⃣ Logging & Monitoring

Track API requests and system logs in real time.
Store logs for at least 90 days in a central system.
Detect unusual activity, like excessive requests from a single IP.
6️⃣ Secure Storage & Data Retention

Only keep user-generated voice data for as long as needed.
Set logs to delete automatically after 30 days.
Restrict access to stored audio files based on user roles.
7️⃣ Incident Response Plan

Have a plan in place in case of a security breach.
Send automatic alerts for suspicious activity.
Run regular security tests to find and fix vulnerabilities.
