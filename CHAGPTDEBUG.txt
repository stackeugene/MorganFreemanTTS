Yes, I see a few potential issues in the script:

1. Padding Issue in prepare_dataset
The script pads or truncates the mel spectrograms to a length of 400 time steps, but it uses:

mel_spectrogram = torch.nn.functional.pad(mel_spectrogram, (0, 0, 0, pad_amount))

The padding format should be (left, right, top, bottom), so (0, 0, pad_amount, 0) might be correct instead.



2. Shape Mismatch in fine_tune_model
Before passing mel_spectrograms to the model, it is permuted:

mel_spectrograms = mel_spectrograms.permute(0, 2, 1)

This changes its shape to [batch_size, num_mel_bins, sequence_length], which may not match what SpeechT5 expects.
If there's a runtime error related to dimension mismatch, try keeping it in [batch_size, sequence_length, num_mel_bins].



3. Error Handling in fine_tune_model
If any error occurs inside the training loop, the script continues without proper debugging:

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error processing batch {i+1}: {e}")
    continue

This could mask critical issues. Consider logging a stack trace:

import traceback
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error processing batch {i+1}: {e}")
    traceback.print_exc()
    continue



4. Incorrect Call to generate_speech
SpeechT5 does not have a generate_speech method. Instead, you likely need:

with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model.generate(**inputs)

Using generate_speech directly may result in an AttributeError.



5. File Path Hardcoding
The dataset path is hardcoded:

train_json_path = r"C:\Users\brynn\OneDrive\Desktop\coleg\MorganFreeman\MorganFreemanTTS\SoundFiles\metadata_train.json"


This will break if another user runs the script. Use os.path.join and make it configurable.
